    "All transactions on the bitcoin network are not created equally. A coinbase transaction is a unique type of bitcoin transaction that can only be created by a miner. This type of transaction has no inputs, and there is one created with each new block that is mined on the network. In other words, this is the transaction that rewards a miner with the block reward for their work. Any transaction fees collected by the miner are also sent in this transaction.
